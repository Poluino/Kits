# WeatherStationPCB
This repository includes all the files to print your own PCB and debug the circuit.

This is the Version 1.2 of the Weather Station PCB designed for the Weather Station Project by Dhruv Sujatha.

The Schematic of the PCB is also included in .pdf format. I will include the KiCad Source files in a later commit.

This is the 6 sensor model with the sensors;

    DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity)
    BMP280 (Pressure & Temperature)
    MQ-135 (Air Quality)
    YL-83 (Rain)
    BH1750(Lux Meter)
    GUVA-S12SD(UV Index Meter)

This PCB was designed using the KiCad Open source software.
